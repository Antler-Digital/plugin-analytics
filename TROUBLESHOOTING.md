# Troubleshooting Guide

This guide helps you solve common issues you might encounter when using the Payload Analytics Plugin.

## Installation Issues

### Plugin Not Loading

**Problem**: The analytics plugin doesn't appear in the Payload admin panel.

**Solutions**:

1. Ensure the plugin is properly added to your Payload config.
2. Check that you're using a compatible version of Payload CMS (v3.17.1+).
3. Verify that the plugin is installed: `pnpm list @antler-digital/plugin-analytics`.

### Script Loading Errors

**Problem**: The analytics script fails to load or throws console errors.

**Solutions**:

1. Check the path to your analytics script in your HTML or Next.js component.
2. Ensure your server is running and serving the analytics.min.js file.
3. Verify there are no CSP (Content Security Policy) issues blocking the script.

## Data Collection Issues

### No Data Being Recorded

**Problem**: Analytics events are not being recorded.

**Solutions**:

1. Check browser console for any errors related to the analytics script.
2. Verify the endpoint URL in your analytics configuration.
3. Ensure the collection exists in your database.
4. Check server logs for any API errors.

### Missing Page Views

**Problem**: Some page views are not being recorded.

**Solutions**:

1. For SPAs, ensure the analytics tracking is properly integrated with your router.
2. Check if ad-blockers or privacy extensions might be blocking the tracking script.
3. Verify the script is loading before the page navigation occurs.

### UTM Parameters Not Tracking

**Problem**: UTM parameters are not being captured.

**Solutions**:

1. Ensure URL parameters are correctly formatted (e.g., `?utm_source=newsletter`).
2. Check that the analytics script initializes before the page fully loads.
3. Verify the analytics endpoint is processing the UTM parameters correctly.

## Dashboard Issues

### Dashboard Not Loading

**Problem**: The analytics dashboard in the admin panel doesn't load.

**Solutions**:

1. Check if you have sufficient permissions to access the dashboard.
2. Verify the dashboard route is correctly configured.
3. Check browser console for any JavaScript errors.

### Charts Not Displaying Data

**Problem**: Dashboard charts are empty or display "No data".

**Solutions**:

1. Ensure there is actual analytics data for the selected time period.
2. Check if data aggregation is working correctly.
3. Verify database connections and queries are executing properly.

### Geographic Data Missing

**Problem**: Geographic visualization is empty or incorrect.

**Solutions**:

1. Ensure IP geolocation is properly configured.
2. Check if geolocation service is working and accessible.
3. Verify the mapping between IP addresses and locations is accurate.

## Performance Issues

### Slow Dashboard Loading

**Problem**: The analytics dashboard takes a long time to load.

**Solutions**:

1. Consider implementing data caching.
2. Optimize database queries for dashboard statistics.
3. Reduce the date range for displayed data.

### Analytics Script Affecting Page Performance

**Problem**: The analytics script is slowing down page loads.

**Solutions**:

1. Load the script with the `defer` attribute or use Next.js's `strategy="afterInteractive"`.
2. Optimize the analytics script bundle size.
3. Consider lazy loading the analytics script.

## Privacy & Compliance Issues

### GDPR Compliance Concerns

**Problem**: Questions about GDPR compliance.

**Solutions**:

1. The plugin is designed to be GDPR compliant by not storing personal data.
2. IP addresses are hashed for anonymity.
3. Consider adding a privacy notice to inform users about analytics tracking.
